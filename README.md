# vim-order-css

A vim plugin that sorts a range of lines by best-practice CSS property
order. Uses "outside in" ordering by importance [1], with a few
exceptions. See [property-order.txt](property-order.txt) for the full list
of CSS properties in their preferred order (as subjectively determined by
this plugin).
